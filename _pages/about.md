My name is Alexandra Engel. 

I am a scientific librarian at the library of the University of Freiburg. Before immersing myself into the world of libraries, I was a doctoral researcher at KU Leuven where I was part of the <a href="https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl">Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics</a> research group (short: QLVL) working in the field of cognitive sociolinguistics under the supervision of Benedikt Szmrecsanyi, Jason Grafmiller, Laura Rosseel and Freek Van de Velde. My research focused on the role of register (i.e. the situational context of language use) in morphosyntactic variation in English and Dutch. To this end, I conducted corpus linguistic analyses and psycholinguistic experiments.
